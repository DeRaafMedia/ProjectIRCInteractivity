To install new Brain use these style rules.

The directory needs to be the EXACT name (lower/upper case) you want to use as name for the IRCBot. Just replace the space (if any) with underscores (i.e Robby_The_Robot).

The Brain.csv file inside the named directory can best be made with Google docs (worksheet) and exported (In the menu file -> download -> download as .csv). It seems Google is one of the view that takes the abriabition .csv (COMMA Seperated Values) serious.

The script should be able to read semicolon seperated files but it's a little bit hit and miss. Office Excel sheets are really buggy!!!
