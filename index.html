<p>This software is meant as a really quick and maybe dirty way (it has a lot of safety third features!) to create a internet enabled serial device which is easily scriptable with Python. It is meant to be used to create interactive installations where you want internet enabled control over physical devices and the only thing available is internet access and a computer with a serial device (Arduino comes to mind, maybe Raspberry Pie) </p>

<p>Plusses : It works via IRC. So no need for a fix IP address or low level access to a network configuration. Just create a IRC channel, write a Python script, drag the script into a folder, put some trigger keywords into a .csv file and your mostly done. That's what it was intended for. </p>

<p>I put some side features into it. Like a text to speech 'feature' for OS X systems (Fatman and Circuitgirl style!). There is also a way to log the IRC chat into a text file. Many more ideas floating around in my head just waiting to pop out. </p>

<p>Also this was a really neat project to sharpen my OOP Python skills a bit. And last but not least, the first time I really want to maintain a piece of code via GitHub (because it's more fun to compute in public). Learning opportunities anyone?</p>

<a name="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use?</h3>

<pre><code>$ cd project/project/directory/
$ python main.py '/dev/your/serial/device/' '115200' '2' 
'serial_port_1' 'physical_device_1' 'IRCBotName' 'YourIRCNick' 
'irc.freenode.net' '6667' '#IRCChannel' 
</code></pre>

<p>Should be enough to create an IRCBot that 'listens' to the IRC channel for certain words that can be 'programmed' in via a simple .csv file (hopefully I'll get to edit the wiki pages A.S.A.P for a more detailed explanation). Those words can trigger an IRC or a serial port event with Python scripts that are formatted a certain way (not really special, just with a little Zen in mind). Because of the use of Python, events don't have to be restricted to IRC or Serial communication.    </p>

<p>Don't kill it! It's probably a feature just waiting to be exploited! But if it really bugs you (pun intended) please contact me with a proposed solution. <a href="https://github.com/DeRaafMedia" class="user-mention">@DeRaafMedia</a></p>

<p>This project is not meant to be used for critical implementations. So don't hook it up to some lifesaving medical devices please.</p>
